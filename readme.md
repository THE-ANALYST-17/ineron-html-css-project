# Project - 08

In this I have created a landing page using Html & CSS

 *Key learnings from this*
1. Got to know about transfrom property in css

2. How to rotate some html element

3. How to use clip path property in css(haven't implement that but got to know about that while googling)

4.  Day by day my confidence is boosting and now looking forward to build some responsive UI.
